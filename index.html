                The author of the poem is a traveller who travels across the countries in the purpose of his business.
                He tends to travel long distances with his fellow mates and explore things. He is a poet and a
                sound listener who tries to express all his hearings in the form of his feelings.
            </p>
            <p>
                This poem is all about a girl whom the author is not knowing about. The author saw her singing on the
                way he crosses by and is addicted to her voice because her voice completely removes his tierdness and
                refreshes his mind. He tries to explain his fellow mates about her singing by hearing her words.
            </p>
            <p>
                Nobody knows exactly about her singing. However, according to author, her voice seems to send a message
                about some of her familiar pain that she has suffered with and wanna remove her sorrow by singing a
                song.

                    Lost in her own thinkings,<br>

                    Perheps some of her familiar loss or pain,<br>

                    I saw a beauty, to be given a friendship ring,<br>
                    So that none of her pain may be pending.<br>
                    <br>
                    However, I have to go on my path,<br>
                    Leaving the sound which refreshed my heart.<br>
                    Hope her singing may remove her sore,<br>

            This poem is all about a shy and beautiful girl who is thinking about something or probably of her past
            which no one correctly knows. The poet is a traveller who is travelling through the way for his purpose of
            business and saw the girl sitting lonely and singing a song which addicts his mind. Her voice rejoices poet
            and removes all of his tierdness that he has come across in his way to destiny. Her voice is giving the poet
            the pleasure, that he is addressing her voice better than any bird. Her voice is so still and calm that even
            in the crowd of noise it is clearly audible and this makes the poet feel proud. However, the poet is unable
            to understand clearly what she is singing about and what her matter is so he asks his mates about it but
            doesn't get any correct explaination. By hearing her voice, he redirects that she may be singing about some
            of her familiar loss or pain which she has suffered with and may suffer again. Lastly, poet conveys that
            whatever she may sings or whatever her song may be about, may her voice deliver what she wanna reveal and
            cures her inevitable sufferings. He addressess her a natural beauty that should be made friend so as to cure
            all of her pain because she is in keen need of care but as the poet is on his way through the purpose of his
            business, he has to go leaving her voice that rejoiced his heart. And on moving he wishes that her pain may
            get over but as he and his mates moved far and far, her voice started fainting and after long time they
            heard her voice no more.
